(Team)
Compiled by Dr. Mathias Fonkam (Instructor)
Project #2 – Data Analysis with Python – An Individual or Team (max 6) Project which you
should each host on your individual Github Account
The broad goal for your Project #2 is to demonstrate some understanding and appreciation for
data analysis using Python and its growing suite of Data Science libraries with a special focus on
the Pandas library. The Pandas library builds on the NumPy and MatPlotlib libraries. In particular
you are required to:
• Identify a raw public dataset of interest to you to employ in your data analytics.
• Download the dataset to your computer and take some time to familiarize yourself with the
raw data and application area.
• Frame some 6 to 10 Questions that you or others in the area may want to answer analyzing
this data.
• Load your data set into a Pandas data frame and do some preprocessing and cleaning if
needed (this should be documented)
• Perform exploratory data analysis & visualization
• Implement your questions as queries on the Pandas dataframe to generate answers making
sure to documenting each code cells implementing each answer.
• Derive insight(s) using answers to your questions
• Communicates those insights as actionable text or a story that may be easy to communicate
and share with others interested in the same dataset.
• Publish your work on github pages at a reachable URL
Project Deliverable & Format
Deliverable: URL of your own GitHub Pages site hosting an .ipynb/.html export of your final
tutorial
• https://pages.github.com/ – you need to register and create a GitHub account
